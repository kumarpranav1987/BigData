Sqoop Import is used to import data from RDBMS to HDFS  

sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/retail_db --username root --password password --table order_items --target-dir /retail_db  

Observations (Look in the logs)
Sqoop Import Execution Life Cycle  
Sqoop import is excuted as a MapReduce job.  
To generate the code for map reduce sqoop needs the schema of the table so it fires a select quuery  
in our case 
INFO manager.SqlManager: Executing SQL statement: SELECT t.* FROM `order_items` AS t LIMIT 1  
Using this schema the required MapReduce code is generated compiled and bundeled into a jar for execution


1)Target HDFS path has been specified using --target-dir so the data is imported in this directory  
We can also pass the target HDFS path using --warehouse-dir, in this case a subdirectory with the name of table is created in the passed directory and data is copied inside that.  


sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/retail_db --username root --password password --table order_items --warehouse-dir /retail_db  

2)Target HDFS directory should be empty otherwise import will fail.

3)Default field deliminator is comma ,
